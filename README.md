This app allows users to interactively explore normal distributions by adjusting mean, standard deviation, and sample size.
It helps students visualize and understand how these parameters affect data distribution.
Open the app, adjust sliders, and view outputs in the tabs.
Developed by Colin Henry as an extra credit project for APMA 3150.
